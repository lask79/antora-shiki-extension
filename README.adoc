This extension wants to make it easier to use {shiki} in {url-antora-docs}[Antora] projects. It offers the following features:

[%header,cols="1s,2a"]
|===
|Feature |Description

|Build-time rendering
|When `Antora` renders the site it will already have the syntax highlighted code blocks. No javascript needed on client.

|Full Shiki Support
|
All {shiki-languages} and {shiki-themes} are supported.

|Adds Asciidoc grammar to Shiki
|Shiki does not offer an Asciidoc grammar. This extension adds the Asciidoc grammar to Shiki which is used by the {asciidoctor-vscode}.

|Multi-Theme Support
|You can define a different theme for each page or even multiple themes on one page.

|Line Numbering
|You can enable line numbering for each code block or for all pages by supporting the line number capabilities of https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/verbatim/source-highlighter/#enable-line-numbering[Asciidoctor]

|Dynamic Line Number color
|Depending on the used background color of the theme the line number color will be adjusted to be better readable.

|===

== Why Shiki instead of Highlight.js?

{shiki} is a syntax highlighter powered by the same language grammars used in Visual Studio Code, ensuring accurate and consistent code coloring.
It offers a wide range of themes and can tokenize code in any language that VS Code supports, making it highly versatile. Unlike many highlighters, Shiki pre-processes code into colored HTML at build time, offering improved performance and consistency across different environments.

*Benefits*

* *Accurate Syntax Highlighting*: Shiki uses the same language grammars as Visual Studio Code, ensuring highly accurate and consistent syntax highlighting.

* *Build-Time Rendering*: Shiki processes code into colored HTML at build time, which can improve page load performance and ensures consistent rendering across different browsers and environments.

* *Wide Range of Themes*: Shiki supports a broad array of themes directly from Visual Studio Code, offering more variety and customization options.

* *Consistent with VS Code*: Developers familiar with Visual Studio Code will find Shiki's highlighting consistent with their development environment, making it easier to integrate into documentation or blogs.

* *Extensive Language Support*: Shiki can tokenize code in any language supported by VS Code, offering extensive language support.

* *Minimal Client-Side Processing*: Since Shiki does the heavy lifting at build time, there is minimal processing required on the client-side, leading to better performance especially on less powerful devices.


== Prerequisites

In order to use this extension, you must be using at least Node.js 16 and Antora 3.
We assume you've already set up an Antora playbook file (i.e., _antora-playbook.yml_) to build your site.

== Installation

Begin by installing the extension package into your {url-antora-docs}/playbook/use-an-existing-playbook-project/[playbook project]:

[source, console]
----
$ npm i antora-shiki-extension
----

== Usage

=== Register the extension

After installing the shiki extension package, you need to {url-antora-docs}/extend/register-extension/[register the extension] with Antora.

To register the extension, you'll add an entry that cites the name of the package to the `antora.extensions` key in your {url-antora-docs}/playbook/[Antora playbook file].

Open the Antora playbook file and add the extension as follows:

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - 'antora-shiki-extension'
----

In order to specify configuration keys for the extension, you must change the entry to a map syntax.
When using the map syntax, the package name must be preceded by the `require` key, as shown here:

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
  - require: 'antora-vscode-extension'
----

You may want to start with this syntax so you don't have to remember to switch to it later when you want to specify configuration.

=== Add handlebars templates

You have to change to add 1 file in your Antora UI bundle or by overwriting it via supplemental-ui:

* add `{{> shiki-styles }}` to `partials/head-styles.hbs`

==== Add to head-styles.hbs

.head-styles.hbs
[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{{uiRootPath}}}/css/site.css">
{{> shiki-styles }}
----

`{{> shiki-styles }}` will be replaced with the content of the file `shiki-styles.hbs` that provided by this extension.

.shiki-styles.hbs
[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{{uiRootPath}}}/css/shiki.css">
----

The `shiki.css` file contains some shiki specific styles that are needed to render the code blocks correctly and overrides some styles defined in the https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/[Antora UI Default].

== Configuration

.Minimal extension configuration
[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: 'antora-shiki-extension'
      # theme: nord
      # themes: []
      # languages: ["asciidoc", "bash", "console", "diff", "java", "js", "shell", "yaml", "xml", "zsh"]
      # use_line_numbers: false
----

.Full extension configuration
[source,yaml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: "antora-shiki-extension"
      theme: "darcula" # default: "nord"
      themes: ["material-theme", "dracula", "slack-dark", "github-light"] # default: []
      languages: # default: see this list
        - asciidoc
        - bash
        - console
        - diff
        - java
        - js
        - shell
        - xml
      use_line_numbers: true # default: false
----

=== Overview

[%header,cols="1s,2a"]
|===
|Configuration key | Details

|theme
|Default: `nord`
Set the default theme that should be used when no theme is defined on the asciidoc pages.

|themes
|Default: []

Defines all themes that should be loaded into the highlighter.
Those can then be used on the asciidoc pages by defining the `shiki-theme` attribute.

|languages
|Default: `["asciidoc", "bash", "console", "diff", "java", "js", "shell", "yaml", "xml", "zsh"]`

Defines which languages are known to `shiki`.

|use_line_numbers
|Default: `false`

If set to true it will always use line numbers for all code blocks.

You can also enable line numbers for each code block. Check https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/verbatim/source-highlighter/#enable-line-numbering[here].

|===

=== Examples

== How it works

=== Process

The extension is called by Antora during the build process. It will then do the following steps:

* validate the configuration
* create the shiki syntax highlighter
* create the asciidoctor syntax highlighter for shiki and register it.
* pass the extension context (logger, config, etc.) to the asciidoctor syntax highlighter
* copy the shiki.css to the uiCatalog
* copy the shiki-styles.hbs to the uiCatalog
* renders each asciidoc page with source blocks (ShikiSyntaxHighlighter)
** calculate the current theme based on the page attributes (`shiki-theme`) and the configuration
** generate the html code for the source block by using the shiki highligher
** extract the background color that is provided by the theme and stored on the returned <pre> element
** calculate if line numbers should be used.
** calculate the line number color based on the background color
** remove the generated surrounding `<pre><code>` elements.
** create new `<pre><code>` elements with the calculated background color and the generated html code
*** sets css variables on <pre>: `--shiki-background-color`

== Use Cases

The following use cases will be shown:

* Default usage with default theme: `nord`
* Change default theme to `darcula` in `Antora` playbook
* Change theme on page level
* Change theme on single source block
* Enable line numbers on source block
* Enable line numbers on specific page
* Enable line numbers on all pages
* Line numbers with specific beginning

=== Default usage with default theme: nord

[source,javascript]
----
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello World');
}
----
:!shiki-theme: #<2>
-------
<1> first you have to define the theme before your source block.
<2> To set it back to default you have to set the theme to `!shiki-theme:`
